# Extraction Test: Sparse Context
#
# Tests extraction from minimal, sparse memos that don't provide
# much context. Should extract what's certain and avoid hallucination.
#
# CATEGORY: Weak case - limited information, tests conservative extraction
# DIFFICULTY: Medium - must avoid over-extraction

# NOTE: We should NOT extract a company or team since none is mentioned

# EXPECTED EDGES
# Should be minimal - only relationships that are explicitly stated

# No edges expected - none are explicitly stated in the memos
