# Extraction Test: Implicit Relationships
#
# Tests extraction of relationships that are implied rather than explicitly stated.
# This is a WEAK CASE where we expect to measure improvement over time.
#
# CATEGORY: Weak case - implicit context, requires inference
# DIFFICULTY: Hard - relationships must be inferred from context
